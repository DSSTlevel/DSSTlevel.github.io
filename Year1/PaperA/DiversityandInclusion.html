                            The Equality Act (EQA) 2010 was created to provide equality of all people.<br>
                            The following 9 are under the protection of this law:<br>
                            -Age<br>
                            -Disability<br>
                            -Gender Reassignment<br>
                            -Marriage and Civil Partnership<br>
                            -Pregnancy and Maternity<br>
                            -Race<br>

                            Demographics describe the <b>characteristics</b> of people/persons

                            The EHRC (Equality and Human Rights Comission) is a code of practice for Services, Functions and Associations, that came into fruition in 2011.<br>
                            It aims to provide guidance in regard to protected persons and characteristics, and to those who provide a service should ensure there is no discrimination.
                            <h1>Inclusion Standards</h1>
                            <div>There are many principles that can come under the equality act in the digital sector. Here are some major examples of these principles:</div>
                            <h2 id="AccessToTech">Access to technology</h2>
                            Often families and people are on low income or benefits, meaning that it can negatively impact their social and working status throughout the environment.
                            This can be recalled back to the <b>digital divide - </b>The inability to afford, connect or gain any technological devices/connections because of budgets (e.g., people living on minimum wage) or local environments (e.g., people living in the countryside (rural areas) are less likely to have internet connection within their household).
                            <h2 id="BiasedData">Checking for bias</h2>
                            Businesses and organisations function through data, most of the time, and stored in data warehouses etc. Maintaining balanced and fair inclusive data should always be checked for biased data before being further worked on/processed.
                            <h2 id="TechnicalKnowledge">Lacking knowledge of Technology</h2>
                            The end user must have some capability to use the technology. With this, they might not be able to use the services they offer, possibly a loss in employment etc.
                            Some of these could be due to disabilities, not raised in the digital era or being born outside of the UK - where the country is not financially stable or doesnt teach digital studies.
                            <h2 id="Benefits">Benefits</h2>
                            More innovative and inclusive products - If the characteristics are considered, it will widen the target audience for products<br>
                            Greater appeal to potential employees - Imcreasing the diversity will help the business as it portrays that it is an "open" workplace, marketing to wider audiences for employees<br> 
                            Ability to connect to BAME groups - Showing more diversity in BAME (Black, Asian and minority ethic) groups can provide for a wider target audience for the product or service<br>
                            Reduced risk of reputation from non-inclusive groups - By removing accessibility and usability barriers, it reduces the risk of being victimised under the Equality Act, increasing profits<br>
                            <h2 id="GovSchemes">Governmental Schemes</h2>
                            Government Initiatives:<br>
                            -Start with user needs<br>
                            -Improve access<br>
                            -Motivate People<br>
                            -Keep it safe<br>
                            -Work with others<br>
                            -Focus on wider outcomes<br>
                            Universal Service Obligation (USO) - An obligation to businesses and areas to have a minimum download speed of 10Mbps for B4RN<br>
                            Broadband for the Rural North (B4RN) - A scheme to introduce connection to the internet into the rural (areas of little to no population) in the North region<br>
                            <h1 id="Effects">Effects of Equality Act</h1>
                            <h3>Positive</h3>
                            Adherance to Guidelines - If a business abides to guidelines, such as Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, this means that inclusivity will increase, reducing the risk of exclusion 
                            Using USO and B4RN - If the business uses the USO and B4RN schemes, this will improve accessibility and inclusivity, branching out to customers, for those who are distant
                            <h3>Negative</h3>
                            Social Isolation - Could result if inclusivity is not taken into consideration for everyone, or the USO speed is not available.
                            <br>
                            If the business does not meet the requirements to the guidelines or if services are inaccessible, they are then liable or are at risk for reduction in a diverse customer range or a victim under the Equality Act 2010
