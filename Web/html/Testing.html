    <h2 id="RCA">Route Cause Analysis</h2>
    <p>
        Route Cause Analysis - The process of identifying the original fauilt through analysising factors that had followed on from the original issue<br>
        Fish Bone Diagram - Visual understanding of the root cause analysis route. Assorting ideas into categories<br>
        <br>
        <b>How to create a Fishbone Diagram?</b><br>
        Agree on a problem statement<br>
        Idenfity the main categories to be inserted into the diagram<br>
        Write the main categories to be decomposed down into small problems<br>
        Identify all the possibilities that had originally caused the issue.<br>
        Final analysis of the problem to see if the search matches<br>
        <br>
        <b>Example</b><br>
        An example of this would be to understand the original cause of a data leakage found from a database through identifying an alternative solution and decomposing it down to see if the route matches the issue.<br>
        </p>
    Concept Testing - Understand the advantages and drawbacks of potential improvement for a particular concept<br>
    Five Whys - Repetition of 5 "why" questions to delve further into the issue, to try and find the root cause<br>
    <h2 id="TestingTypes">Testing Types</h2>
    Functionality Testing - Confirming of component functionality and readiness against requirements<br>
    Usability Testing - Verification of component functionality and readiness to release<br>
    Compatability Testing - Confirm that components can work alongside with software and hardware<br>
    Accessibility Testing - Form of usability testing that checks the inclusion of the services/products to the end user<br>
    Customer/End User Satisfaction Survey -  Confirm the experience mood of the end user, whether this be positive or negative<br>
    Fault Finding and Debugging - Finding to search for the bugs and errors, then debug/fix these bugs and errors<br>
    Impact Assessment - Implications for a business, the environments and people of the implementation of components<br>
    Efficiency of individual components - Tests the performance of a component and its resources required for its function<br>
    Review accuracy of data - Review of data to test if there is bad data in the business<br>
    Ensuring desired outcomes - Making sure the service/product meets the needs of the end user, business, and employees<br>
    Performance monitoring - Acts as a warning system that reports to the IT team when something has "gone wrong"<br>
    <h2 id="DigitalComponents">Digital Componenents</h2>
    Software - Points out any defects and errors for the software<br>
    Hardware - Ensure that all components perform, function and operate correctly<br>
    Data - Relates to Review accuracy of data, and check feasability of the data.<br>
    <li>Valid Data - Data that is accepted and can be used</li>
    <li>Extreme/Borderline - Border data from a range of data</li>
    <li>Erroneous - Invalid or unaccetable data that can not be used</li>
    Interfaces - Ensures that each component works in collaboration with other components<br>
    Test Scripts - Descriptions that contain information about the transactions of the system<br>
    
    Usability/Audience Testing - Understand how end users interact with the product or service and whether it meets their requirements<br>
    Stress Testting - Whether a system can function with expected demand by replicated a real world experience
    <li>Load Testing - Performance test that is used to check the system performance</li>
    <li>Stress Testing - Performance test that is used to check the limits of the system performance</li>
    Penetration Testing - An authorised attack on a system to test its vulnerability<br>
    Black Box Testing - Penetration testing without having any background information about the system<br>
    White box Testing - Penetration testing but has information about the system<br>
